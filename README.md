**GUY** is like [wuy](https://github.com/manatlan/wuy)

It's the new name, but it is the same thing ...

* more robust
* no more "Server mode" : only window mode !
* works on Android (with kivy)

You can build a py/html app which will work on **windows**, on **mac**, on **linux** or on **android** (it should be easy to port to iOS too) !
