# Demo

Only server's modes are available as demo :

- Here is a [demo](https://starter-guy.glitch.me/#/) ([sources](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/starter-guy)), of a simple guy's app (server mode).
- Here is a [demo](https://starter-guy-vuejs.glitch.me/#/) ([sources](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/starter-guy-vuejs)), of a guy's app serving a vuejs/sfc UI.

If you want to try app/cef mode, just look the [test*.py files here](https://github.com/manatlan/guy)
